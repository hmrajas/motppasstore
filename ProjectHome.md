# MOTP Passtore #
## Online Password Manager with two factor authentification ##
MOTP Passtore gives you the tools to organize your passwords all in one place. Easy to access and even more secure. Your passwords will be kept on the server encrypted by passcode known by you only. Your Passtore account can only be accessed using onetime passwords (OTP) which completely mitigates the threat of keylogger and similar type trojans, as well as the man-in-the-middle attacks. mOTP is used as a second factor authentification, so you only need your mobile phone to increase your security
